"Hurricane Melissa is now a rare Category 5 storm as it closes in on a historic, catastrophic landfall in Jamaica",2025-10-25 00:00:00,https://www.cnn.com,"Melissa rapidly intensified over the weekend and is now a rare Category 5 hurricane with 160 mph winds. The National Hurricane Center expects it to make landfall in Jamaica on Tuesday morning as the strongest hurricane on record to strike the island.

The center of the hurricane is located about 130 miles south of Kingston, Jamaica and the storm is moving westward at just 3 mph.

“Do not venture out of your safe shelter,” the NHC said Monday morning. “Catastrophic and life-threatening flash flooding and numerous landslides are likely today through Tuesday. Destructive winds, especially in the mountains, will begin by this evening, leading to extensive infrastructural damage, long-lasting power and communication outages, and isolated communities.”

Tropical storm conditions are already ongoing in Jamaica and hurricane conditions will arrive tonight into early Tuesday as Melissa pushes onshore.

The Jamaican government issued mandatory evacuation orders Sunday evening for several vulnerable coastal communities, including parts of Kingston, as Melissa intensifies on its approach to the Caribbean nation.

“Storm surge is expected mainly over the southern side of the island, and this would be to the east of the center as it starts to, as it approaches the south coast, and as it begins to make impact,” Evan Thompson, the principal director of Jamaica’s Meteorological Service, said Sunday.

A hurricane warning is effect for Jamaica, where hurricane conditions are expected by Monday night. Cuba has also issued a hurricane warning for the eastern provinces of Granma, Santiago de Cuba, Guantanamo and Holguin. A tropical storm warning has been issued for much of Haiti, and the government of the Bahamas has issued a hurricane watch for the central and southeastern Bahamas and the Turks and Caicos Islands.

Melissa has been moving at a snail’s pace for days and it won’t pick up speed anytime soon as it tracks generally westward until Monday afternoon.

That slow movement has already caused problems. Torrential rain bands have swamped Haiti and the Dominican Republic the last several days, causing flooding and triggering landslides. At least three deaths have been reported in Haiti due to the storm, two of which were the result of a landslide, the Haitian Civil Protection Agency said in a statement. In the Dominican Republic, at least one person has died and more than 1,000 people have evacuated or been displaced, officials said Friday.

Melissa doubled in strength over the weekend as it underwent extreme rapid intensification over exceptionally warm water in the Caribbean.

This explosive strengthening is happening more often as the world warms due to fossil fuel pollution. Three of the four Atlantic hurricanes this season underwent extreme rapid intensification: Erin, Gabrielle and Humberto.

Melissa’s extreme threats

Jamaica, Haiti and the southern Dominican Republic will face the worst of the storm through Tuesday. Next in line for strong winds, storm surge and flooding rain will be eastern Cuba, the southern Bahamas and Turks and Caicos.

Rainfall totals up to 30 inches are expected from Melissa in parts of southern Hispaniola and Jamaica through Wednesday, with local maxima of 40 inches. Eastern Cuba could receive totals of up to 20 inches.

Jamaica will not only endure Melissa’s torrential rain, but will also have to contend with days of ferocious winds. The most extreme winds will likely occur as Melissa tracks over Jamaica on Monday night into Tuesday. Downed trees, power outages and structural damage could be widespread.

Winds on windward sides of hills and mountains could be 30% higher than what lower elevations experience, the hurricane center warned.

Officials in the country are already preparing for the worst. All public hospitals have been in “emergency mode” since Thursday evening, halting outpatient and elective procedures to ensure more beds are open, according to Christopher Tufton, Jamaica’s Minister of Health and Wellness.

Emergency shelters have been “activated” across the country for people living in vulnerable areas, Minister of Local Government Desmond McKenzie said Sunday in a press conference.

Jamaica’s airports are closing. Norman Manley International Airport closed after its last scheduled arriving flight at 8 p.m. local time (9 p.m. ET) Saturday evening, according to Daryl Vaz, the minister of transport.

The Sangster International Airport also closed on Sunday, Vaz said.

“There is nowhere that will escape the wrath of this hurricane,” Thompson, from Jamaica’s Meteorological Service, said Saturday. “It’s going to sit there, pouring water while it’s barely moving and that is a significant challenge… as long as what is predicted does take place.”

Peak storm surge heights could reach 9 to 13 feet above ground level, near and to the east of where the center of Melissa makes landfall. Storm surge will also be accompanied by large and destructive waves.

“Now is the time to secure your home, check your roof, windows, and surroundings. Use sandbags or plywood where needed and clear any overhanging branches safely,” Holness, the prime minister, wrote on X. “If you live in a flood-prone area, take protective measures and have an evacuation plan ready”

Jamaicans who spoke with Reuters on Saturday acknowledged the danger of a slow-moving hurricane, contrasting Melissa’s sluggish pace to Hurricane Beryl.

“Slow movement still cause a lot of damage, right?” said fisherman Clive Davis in Kingston. “Different from Beryl cause Beryls come with a speed and never stay too long. Just sweep through. But this now, she wants to come stay, visit Jamaica for 3 days, why?”

“It’s gonna slow down business, but it’s nature,” Davis added. “We can’t fight against nature, right?”

Into Saturday, workers in Kingston dredged as much trash and silt as they could from the bottom of Sandy Gully, an approximately 20 km long waterway snaking along the city’s western flank. When Melissa brings its months’ worth of rain as it passes over Jamaica, the swollen, debris-filled gully could knock out bridges, splitting Kingston in two.

The United States mainland is not expected to be directly threatened by Melissa. Even so, rough surf and rip currents could spread along the US East Coast next week.

Hurricane Beryl in July 2024 was the last storm to heavily impact Jamaica.

Tropical Storm Melissa threatens Jamaica with days of hurricane conditions as it is set to rapidly intensify in the Caribbean,2025-10-24 00:00:00,https://edition.cnn.com,"Jamaica and other parts of the Caribbean are staring down what could become a catastrophic, days-long assault of extreme rainfall and damaging winds with a strengthening Tropical Storm Melissa expected to become a major hurricane over some of the hottest ocean water on the planet.

Officials are urging anyone in Melissa’s path to prepare for life-threatening flooding, landslides, power outages and dangerous seas.

Melissa could be the strongest hurricane ever to hit Jamaica. Its rain has already been pounding parts of Haiti and the Dominican Republic for several days, flooding roadways and triggering landslides. At least three deaths have been reported in Haiti due to the storm, two of which were the result of a landslide, the Haitian Civil Protection Agency said in a statement.

In the Dominican Republic, at least one person has died and more than 1,000 people have evacuated or been displaced as a result of Melissa’s flooding rain, emergency operations officials said at a Friday news conference.

As of early Saturday, Melissa was about 170 miles southeast of Kingston, Jamaica, with sustained winds of 70, just shy of hurricane strength, according to the National Hurricane Center (NHC). The storm is hardly moving – drifting at just 3 mph – but is starting to strengthen.

The Meteorological Service of Jamaica has issued a hurricane warning for the country, according to the NHC. Hurricane watches and tropical storm warnings are in effect for southern Haiti, with strong winds set to arrive as soon as Friday night and ramp up over the weekend.

Melissa is expected to become a hurricane by Saturday morning and rapidly intensify into a major hurricane of Category 3 or higher over the weekend.

The NHC forecasts Melissa to peak at a high-end Category 4 hurricane with 155 mph winds Sunday night and Monday as it churns south of Jamaica, but notes “there is a distinct possibility that Melissa could become a Category 5 hurricane.” Category 5 hurricanes have winds of 157 mph or higher.

This explosive strengthening is happening more often as the world warms due to fossil fuel pollution. Three of the four Atlantic hurricanes this season underwent extreme rapid intensification: Erin, Gabrielle and Humberto.

Melissa’s extreme threats

Jamaica and Haiti are expected to feel the worst of Melissa’s wrath in the coming days, but surrounding countries cannot let their guards down.

A foot or more of rain is possible in parts of Jamaica, southern Haiti and the southern Dominican Republic through early next week.

CNN Weather

“Extensive damage to roads and buildings is expected, potentially isolating communities for an extended period of time,” the hurricane center warned of Haiti on Friday. “This is a life-threatening situation and immediate preparations to protect life and property should be taken.”

Jamaica will not only endure Melissa’s torrential rain, but will also have to contend with days of the storm’s ferocious winds. The nation of nearly 3 million people will likely face tropical storm-force winds late Friday into Saturday, while hurricane-force winds build over the weekend and last into early next week. Downed trees, power outages and structural damage are all possible, though the timing for the strongest winds is still coming into focus.

Officials in the country are already preparing for the worst. All public hospitals have been in “emergency mode” since Thursday evening, according to Christopher Tufton, Jamaica’s minister of health. This designation halts outpatient and elective procedures and ensures more beds are open for emergencies.

Jamaica’s airports remain open for now, but will likely close within 24 hours of a hurricane warning being issued for the country, according to Daryl Vaz, minister of science, energy, telecommunications and transport.

“I urge Jamaicans to take this weather threat seriously,” Prime Minister Andrew Holness said in a news conference Friday. “You have been given enough notice that (Melissa) is coming and that it could be disastrous, so take all measures to protect yourself.”

After Melissa roars by Jamaica, Cuba is likely to be the next country in the storm’s path. Eastern Cuba could face destructive winds and flooding rain from Melissa by midweek. The Bahamas and Turks and Caicos could also see impacts later in the week.

The United States mainland is not completely out of the woods, but a direct hit looks unlikely. Even so, rough surf and rip currents could spread along the US East Coast next week.

Why Melissa’s forecast is so alarming

It’s barely moving. When a storm crawls like this, rainfall piles up over the same towns for days. A similar setup produced catastrophic floods in 2017 with When a storm crawls like this, rainfall piles up over the same towns for days. A similar setup produced catastrophic floods in 2017 with Hurricane Harvey , which dumped over four feet of rain on parts of Texas, and in 2019 with Hurricane Dorian , which dropped nearly two feet of rain in the Bahamas and over a foot in parts of South Carolina.

Mountains magnify the flood threat. Haiti, Jamaica and the Dominican Republic’s steep terrain will force air upward, wringing out more moisture from the storm, just like squeezing a wet sponge, turning tropical humidity into torrents racing downhill. Mudslides are all but guaranteed in this scenario.

Mudslides are all but guaranteed in this scenario. This happened when Hurricane Helene devastated western North Carolina last year.

Heat in the Caribbean Sea runs deep. The Caribbean’s exceptionally warm water extends far below the surface, preventing the usual “stirring up” of cooler water that can weaken hurricanes. Melissa is expected to feast on that deep reservoir of heat, raising the ceiling on its potential intensity.

Hurricane forecast: Melissa is expected to become a major hurricane. It could be a worst-case scenario for Jamaica,2025-10-23 00:00:00,https://edition.cnn.com,"Tropical Storm Melissa is barely moving through the Caribbean, and that’s exactly what makes it so dangerous. The longer it lingers, the more rain it dumps and the more likely it is to rapidly intensify into a monster storm.

Intensity forecasts have ramped up considerably in the past few days. A worst-case scenario for some Caribbean islands is increasingly likely with Melissa set to reach at least Category 4 hurricane strength next week, fueled by extremely warm water.

A tropical storm warning is in effect for Jamaica with Melissa’s outermost winds expected to reach there in the next day or so. Hurricane watches are in effect for Jamaica and parts of Haiti, meaning hurricane-force winds are possible by the weekend. Haiti, Jamaica and parts of the Dominican Republic face days of heavy rain that threaten significant flash flooding and dangerous mudslides.

Jamaica could end up being the epicenter of the worst Melissa has to offer, based on current forecasts. Preparations were well underway in the country Thursday as officials urged residents to take Melissa seriously and stay vigilant.

All public hospitals are set to go into “emergency mode” Thursday evening, Christopher Tufton, Jamaica’s Minister of Health and Wellness confirmed at a news conference. This designation halts outpatient and elective procedures and ensures more beds are open for emergencies.

Jamaica’s airports remain open for now, but will likely close within 24 hours of a hurricane warning being issued for the country, according to Daryl Vaz, Minister of Science, Energy, Telecommunications and Transport.

As of Thursday evening, Melissa was about 165 miles south-southeast of Kingston, Jamaica, with sustained winds of 45 mph, according to the National Hurricane Center. It’s drifting north-northwest at just 2 mph, slower than the average person on an afternoon stroll.

Melissa is forecast to reach hurricane strength by the weekend and will likely rapidly intensify into a major hurricane — Category 3 or greater — Monday. This explosive strengthening is happening more often as the world warms due to fossil fuel pollution. Three of the four Atlantic hurricanes this season underwent extreme rapid intensification: Erin, Gabrielle and Humberto.

Melissa is already bringing heavy rain to parts of the Caribbean. Up to 10 inches of rain could fall, with isolated totals topping a foot across southern Haiti, southern Dominican Republic and eastern Jamaica through the weekend. Those totals will likely climb even higher early next week, but by exactly how much depends on Melissa’s track and intensity.

Rainfall totals through early next week are problematic for several Caribbean countries. CNN Weather

The United States mainland is not completely out of the woods, but a direct hit looks unlikely. If Melissa takes longer to turn north, it could bend toward eastern Cuba or the Bahamas before curving into the Atlantic. Even so, rough surf and rip currents could spread along the US East Coast next week.

There’s also still a slim chance that Melissa takes a sharp turn to the north earlier than expected and bears down directly on Haiti. That scenario would deliver highly-concentrated impacts there and torrential rain to the Dominican Republic.

Hurricane forecast: Melissa is now forecast to become a major hurricane as it trends toward a concerning track,2025-10-22 00:00:00,https://edition.cnn.com,"Tropical Storm Melissa is crawling through the Caribbean Sea, threatening to unleash life-threatening flooding and mudslides across parts of the region later this week. It’s proof this year’s Atlantic hurricane season is not over yet, and Melissa has plenty of time and fuel ahead.

Melissa was about 300 miles southeast of Kingston, Jamaica, with maximum sustained winds of 50 mph as of Wednesday afternoon, according to the National Hurricane Center. It was churning forward at an agonizingly slow 2 mph.

Heavy rain is already spreading north Wednesday as Melissa moves at a snail’s pace toward Jamaica and Haiti. A foot or more of rain is possible in southern parts of Haiti and the Dominican Republic through this weekend. That much rain over mountainous terrain in the area could trigger catastrophic flash flooding and landslides.

Melissa is moving over water that’s so warm it’s essentially rocket fuel for storms this late in the season, and is expected to hit hurricane status by Saturday morning.

When that happens, it will be the 2025 Atlantic season’s fifth hurricane and the first to spin up inside the Caribbean. It’s also now forecast to become the season’s fourth major hurricane — Category 3 or greater.

A hurricane watch has been issued for parts of Haiti and a tropical storm watch is in effect for Jamaica. There’s a low, but non-zero chance Melissa directly impacts the mainland United States, though details are still coming into focus.

Here’s what we know so far.

Two possible outcomes, neither good

Melissa’s exact track is still tricky to pin down, but there are two main scenarios. The possibilities have changed slightly from initial forecasts, but both place Hispaniola and Jamaica in harm’s way.

Melissa could bring close to a foot of rain to parts of Hispaniola, which is the island that houses the Dominican Republic and Haiti, as it drifts closer to the island through the weekend.

It’s still unclear exactly what parts of Haiti and the Dominican Republic would be subject to the heaviest rain, but the combination of torrential rain and mountainous terrain is a recipe for dangerous flash flooding and mudslides. Jamaica could also receive torrential, flooding rainfall beginning later this week.

The islands will also face strong, potentially damaging winds from Melissa, especially after it reaches hurricane strength Saturday, according to the hurricane center’s forecast.

CNN Weather

Slow-moving storms like Melissa hit the same areas with torrential rain and strong winds for days, significantly increasing rainfall totals and the likelihood of power outages. Melissa will start moving quicker at some point, and exactly when and where that happens is extremely important to determine its impacts. It’s also still quite unclear.

If Melissa’s current forecast track holds and the storm moves slowly west toward an area south of Jamaica into early next week, it could end up where the atmosphere and extremely warm water align to boost the storm.

Melissa is now expected to become at least a Category 4 major hurricane by Monday.

Its anticipated explosion in strength from tapping into that energy is something that’s happening more often as the world warms due to fossil fuel pollution. Just this year, three of the four Atlantic hurricanes to date underwent extreme rapid intensification: Erin, Gabrielle and Humberto.

A stronger Melissa would eventually turn northeast next week and threaten other portions of the Caribbean, like Cuba. That scenario would increase the intensity of all of Melissa’s impacts from rain to wind and dangerous seas.

Alternatively, there’s still a chance that another weather pattern could pull Melissa north toward Jamaica or Haiti early next week. This path would likely prevent Melissa from reaching the strength it might in the first scenario, but could also mean a direct landfall and more concentrated impacts in either location.

Is this a threat to the US?

A direct hit on the mainland US is unlikely, but not impossible. At this time, the storm’s most likely impact to the US could be some rough surf and rip currents along the East Coast next week.

Florida could be in play if Melissa takes a turn to the north later than currently expected. In that case, Cuba and parts of the Bahamas could also be hit with Melissa’s wind and rain.

The odds of a hurricane landfall in the US really dwindle at the end of October and into November, but there have been notable late-season exceptions. Most recently, Hurricane Nicole slammed into Florida as a Category 1 in early November 2022 and Hurricane Zeta smashed into Louisiana as a Category 3 in late October 2020.

As Melissa continues to develop in the coming days, its track, strength and threats will come into sharper focus.

"Tropical Storm Melissa is expected to become a hurricane. Its track is unclear, but it’s bringing a dangerous threat",2025-10-21 00:00:00,https://edition.cnn.com,"Tropical Storm Melissa has formed in the Caribbean Sea, proving this year’s Atlantic hurricane season won’t be wrapping up quietly.

The storm could slam the northern Caribbean with pouring rain and strong winds as it strengthens over extremely warm water this week. Melissa’s worst impacts could center on Hispaniola, where significant flooding and dangerous mudslides are possible for parts of the Dominican Republic and Haiti through the weekend.

Melissa was churning about 300 miles south of Haiti with maximum sustained winds of 50 mph as of Tuesday evening, according to the National Hurricane Center.

The storm is expected to hit hurricane status by Saturday, according to the center, but it’s still tough to pin down exactly how strong it will become from there.

A hurricane watch has been issued for parts of Haiti and a tropical storm watch is in effect for Jamaica.

There’s a low, but non-zero chance Melissa directly impacts the mainland United States, though details are still coming into focus. Puerto Rico is much more likely to experience some of the storm’s rain.

Here’s what we know so far.

Days of rain and wind

Melissa’s exact track is still tricky to pin down, but there are two main scenarios forecasters have been monitoring for days. The one looking most likely at this point could spell disaster for parts of Hispaniola; the other could eventually take Melissa close to Central America.

Both involve Melissa first loitering out over the Caribbean Sea for multiple days this week, churning up seas and bringing nasty weather to islands within the storm’s reach.

From there, Melissa could take a turn to the north by late week and potentially move close to Hispaniola through the weekend, strengthening into a Category 1 hurricane by Saturday morning. This is the scenario the hurricane center’s track for the system reflects.

Melissa is the 13th named storm of the season but is the first to churn in the Caribbean Sea. The lack of storms allowed the Caribbean to become so extremely warm that its water is now basically rocket fuel for storms.

If Melissa taps into that energy, it could explode in strength – something that’s happening more often as the world warms due to fossil fuel pollution. Just this year, three of the four Atlantic hurricanes to date underwent extreme rapid intensification: Erin, Gabrielle and Humberto.

Melissa could bring more than a foot of rain to parts of Hispaniola. It’s still unclear exactly what parts of the Dominican Republic and Haiti would be subject to the heaviest rain, but the combination of torrential rain and mountainous terrain is a recipe for dangerous flash flooding and mudslides.

Melissa could also deliver a considerable amount of rain to Jamaica and Puerto Rico in this scenario, with flash flooding and mudslides possible.

Alternately, there’s still a chance that Melissa misses its window to take a northward turn and instead just creeps west over the Caribbean until it nears Central America — potentially Nicaragua or Honduras — next week. It could make landfall there or take a very late turn to the north and head for Cuba.

The northern Caribbean would likely still receive a few days of wet and windy weather in this scenario, but rainfall totals would be lower, as would the flood risk, with Melissa moving steadily west.

So… will it hit the US?

It’s unlikely — though not entirely impossible — Melissa will deliver a direct hit to the mainland US. At this time, the storm’s most likely impact to the US could be in the form of some rough surf and rip currents along the East Coast next week.

Florida could be in play if Melissa remains a weaker storm for longer and takes a turn to the north later than currently expected. In that case, Cuba and parts of the Bahamas could also be hit with Melissa’s wind and rain.

The odds of a hurricane landfall in the US really dwindle at the end of October and into November, but there have been notable late-season exceptions. Most recently, Hurricane Nicole slammed into Florida as a Category 1 in early November 2022 and Hurricane Zeta smashed into Louisiana as a Category 3 in late October 2020.

As Melissa continues to develop in the coming days, its track, strength and threats will come into sharper focus.

Jamaica braces as Hurricane Melissa strengthens offshore,2025-10-27 00:00:00,https://www.aljazeera.com,"The Category 5 storm which could bring up to one metre of rain to Jamaica is moving towards the Caribbean island at a worryingly slow pace.

Jamaicans have been urged to take shelter as Hurricane Melissa continued to strengthen offshore.

The hurricane, which on Monday intensified to a Category 5 storm, was threatening to hit the Caribbean island nation hard. The slow pace at which it is moving, just 7 kilometres (4 miles) an hour, suggests that areas in the hurricane’s path could suffer extended punishing conditions and significant volumes of rainfall.

Melissa was centred about 205km (130 miles) south-southwest of Kingston, Jamaica, and about 495km (310 miles) south-southwest of Guantanamo, Cuba, on Sunday night. Landfall in Jamaica is not expected until late Monday or early Tuesday.

Category 5 is the highest on the Saffir-Simpson scale with sustained winds exceeding 250 kilometres per hour (157 miles per hour).

Up to about 1 metre (40 inches) of rainfall could hit parts of Jamaica as the storm passes directly over the island, threatening flash flooding and landslides.

“This extreme rainfall potential, owing to the slow motion, is going to create a catastrophic event here for Jamaica,” US National Hurricane Center (NHC) Deputy Director Jamie Rhome said in a webcast briefing.

“You need to just be wherever you’re going to be and be ready to ride this out for several days,” Rhome said.

Jamaica’s government ordered mandatory evacuations late on Sunday for Port Royal in Kingston, Portland Cottage and Rocky Point in Clarendon, Old Harbour Bay in St Catherine and Taylor Land, Bull Bay, New Haven and Riverton City in St Andrew.

“Many of these communities will not survive this flooding,” Desmond McKenzie, minister of local government, said at a news conference. “Kingston is low, extremely low … No community in Kingston is immune from flooding.

“There is nothing more we can do as a government but to beg and beseech persons to heed the warning. And if it will help, I will go on my knees,” he said.

“This is one bet you cannot win. You cannot bet against Melissa,” McKenzie warned, advising that people could go to more than 650 shelters that are open across the country.

Evan Thompson, the principal director of the Meteorological Service of Jamaica, said the storm surge is expected mainly over the southern side of the island.

“There is potential (for) flooding in every parish of our country,” Thompson said.

“If you’re in a flood-prone, low-lying area, you need to take note. If you’re near a river course or a gully, you need to take special note and find some alternative location that you can move to should you be threatened by the heavy rainfall.”

The AFP news agency spoke with Winston Moxam as he hurried to prepare his home for the approaching storm.

“I lose my roof, I lose a whole lot of things,” Maxim said, adding that he was particularly worried by warnings the storm could be worse than 1988’s Hurricane Gilbert, which left more than 40 dead in Jamaica and killed hundreds more around the Caribbean and in Mexico.

Jamaica’s two main airports, the Norman Manley International Airport and Sangster International Airport in Montego Bay, as well as seaports, were closed.

Trail of destruction

After passing over Jamaica, the storm is forecast to head north and cross over eastern Cuba on Tuesday night, while continuing to bring rains and heavy winds to Haiti and the Dominican Republic.

Melissa has already been blamed for at least four deaths in Haiti and the Dominican Republic this week, as its outer bands brought heavy rains and landslides.

The Dominican Republic’s emergency operations centre has placed nine of 31 provinces on red alert due to a risk of flash floods, rising rivers and landslides.

The Cuban government issued a hurricane warning for the provinces of Granma, Santiago de Cuba, Guantanamo, and Holguin. It also sent a tropical storm warning to the province of Las Tunas.

Climate change ‘a daily reality’

Although Jamaica is used to hurricanes, climate change is making tropical storms more frequent and severe, including by causing heavier rainfall and slower-moving storms, due to warming oceans and air temperatures.

With a population of less than three million people, Jamaica is responsible for just 0.02 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions, according to data from the World Resources Institute, but as an island nation, it is expected to continue to bear the brunt of worsening climate effects.

Speaking at the United Nations General Assembly in September, Jamaica’s Prime Minister Andrew Holness urged wealthy countries to increase climate financing to assist countries like Jamaica with adapting.

“Climate change is not a distant threat or an academic consideration. It is a daily reality for small island developing states like Jamaica,” he said.

Melissa is the 13th named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season, which runs from early June to late November.

The last major hurricane to affect Jamaica was Beryl in early July 2024, which was an abnormally strong storm for the time of year.

Beryl brought downpours and strong winds to Jamaica as it moved past the island’s southern coast, leaving at least four people dead.",category storm could bring one metre rain jamaica move towards caribbean island worryingly slow pace jamaican urge take shelter hurricane melissa continue strengthen offshore hurricane monday intensify category storm threaten hit caribbean island nation hard slow pace move kilometre mile hour suggest area hurricane path could suffer extended punishing condition significant volume rainfall melissa centre mile kingston jamaica mile guantanamo cuba sunday night landfall jamaica expect late monday early tuesday category high scale sustained wind exceed kilometre per hour mile per hour metre inch rainfall could hit part jamaica storm pass directly island threaten flash flooding landslide extreme rainfall potential owe slow motion go create catastrophic event jamaica u national hurricane center nhc deputy director jamie rhome say webcast briefing need wherever go ready ride several day rhome say jamaica government order mandatory evacuation late sunday port royal kingston portland cottage rocky point clarendon old harbour bay st catherine taylor land bull bay new riverton city st andrew advertisement many community survive flooding desmond mckenzie minister local government say news conference kingston low extremely low community kingston immune flood nothing government beg beseech person heed warning help go knee say one bet win bet melissa mckenzie warn advise people could go shelter open across country evan thompson principal director meteorological service jamaica say storm surge expect mainly southern side island potential flooding every parish country thompson say area need take note near river course gully need take special note find alternative location move threaten heavy afp news agency speak winston moxam hurry prepare home approaching storm lose roof lose whole lot thing maxim say add particularly worry warning storm could bad hurricane gilbert leave dead jamaica kill hundred around caribbean mexico jamaica two main airport norman manley international airport sangster international airport montego bay well seaport close trail destruction pass jamaica storm forecast head north cross eastern cuba tuesday night continue bring rain heavy wind haiti dominican republic melissa already blame least four death haiti dominican republic week outer band bring heavy rain landslide dominican republic emergency operation centre place nine province red alert due risk flash flood rise river landslide cuban government issue hurricane warning province granma santiago de cuba guantanamo holguin also send tropical storm warning province las tuna climate change daily reality although jamaica use hurricane climate change make tropical storm frequent severe include cause heavy rainfall storm due warm ocean air temperature advertisement population less three million people jamaica responsible percent global greenhouse gas emission accord data world resource institute island nation expect continue bear brunt worsen climate effect speaking united nation general assembly september jamaica prime minister andrew holness urge wealthy country increase climate financing assist country like jamaica adapt climate change distant threat academic consideration daily reality small island develop state like jamaica say melissa name storm atlantic hurricane season run early june late november last major hurricane affect jamaica beryl early july abnormally strong storm time year beryl bring downpour strong wind jamaica move past island southern coast leave least four people dead,True,"jamaica, climate, storm, say, hurricane"
"Hurricane Melissa, now Category 4, threatens heavy floods in Jamaica, Haiti",2025-10-26 00:00:00,https://www.aljazeera.com,"Melissa is expected to strengthen even further into a major catastrophic hurricane when making landfall in Jamaica.

Hurricane Melissa has rapidly strengthened into a major Category 4 with potentially catastrophic consequences, as it dropped torrential rain in the northern Caribbean and threatened disastrous flooding and landslides in Jamaica and southern Haiti.

Melissa could intensify to a Category 5 as it nears Jamaica, forecasters said on Sunday, when making landfall in the Caribbean island in the coming day or two.

“I urge Jamaicans to take this weather threat seriously,” said Jamaican Prime Minister Andrew Holness. “Take all measures to protect yourself.”

Melissa was centred about 200km (125 miles) south-southeast of Kingston, Jamaica, and about 455km (280 miles) west-southwest of Port-au-Prince, Haiti, late Saturday night.

It had maximum sustained winds of 185 kilometres per hour (115 miles per hour), the hurricane centre said.

Authorities in Jamaica said on Saturday that the Norman Manley International Airport in Kingston will be closed. They did not say whether they will close the Sangster airport in Montego Bay, on the western side of the island.

More than 650 shelters were activated in Jamaica. Officials said warehouses across the island were well-stocked and thousands of food packages prepositioned for quick distribution if needed.

Melissa was expected to unleash punishing rains of up to 76 centimetres (30 inches) on Jamaica and southern Hispaniola – Haiti and the Dominican Republic – according to the hurricane centre.

It should be near or over Cuba by the middle of the week. The Cuban government on Saturday afternoon issued a hurricane watch for the provinces of Granma, Santiago de Cuba, Guantanamo and Holguin.

The erratic and slow-moving storm has killed at least three people in Haiti and a fourth person in the Dominican Republic, where another person remains missing.

“Unfortunately for places along the projected path of this storm, it is increasingly dire,” Jamie Rhome, the centre’s deputy director, said earlier on Saturday. He said the storm will continue to move slowly for up to four days.

In Haiti, there were also reports of rising river levels, flooding and a bridge destroyed due to breached riverbanks in Sainte-Suzanne, in the northeast.

“The storm is causing a lot of concern with the way it’s moving,” said Ronald Delice, a Haitian department director of civil protection, as local authorities organised lines to distribute food kits. Many residents are still reluctant to leave their homes.

The storm has damaged nearly 200 homes in the Dominican Republic and knocked out water supply systems, affecting more than half a million customers. It also downed trees and traffic lights, unleashed a couple of small landslides and left more than two dozen communities isolated by floodwaters.

The Bahamas Department of Meteorology said Melissa could bring tropical storm or hurricane conditions to islands in the Southeast and Central Bahamas and the Turks and Caicos Islands by early next week.

"Hurricane Melissa rapidly intensifies, threatening major Caribbean flooding",2025-10-25 00:00:00,https://www.aljazeera.com,"Jamaica, Dominican Republic and Haiti brace for ‘catastrophic flooding’ as storm set to strengthen into hurricane.

Tropical Storm Melissa has strengthened into a hurricane, the United States-based National Hurricane Center (NHC) says, as people across several Caribbean countries braced for heavy rainfall and dangerous flooding.

Hurricane Melissa was located about 380km (235 miles) southwest of the Haitian capital of Port-au-Prince, packing maximum sustained winds of 120 kilometres (75 miles) per hour, the NHC said in its latest advisory on Saturday afternoon.

A hurricane warning was in place for Jamaica as the NHC said life-threatening and catastrophic flash flooding and landslides were expected in portions of southern Hispaniola island – shared by Haiti and the Dominican Republic – and Jamaica into early next week.

The centre of Melissa was expected to move near or over Jamaica during the weekend and early next week, the NHC said, adding that it could be near or over eastern Cuba by the middle of next week.

A hurricane watch was also in effect for the southwestern peninsula of Haiti, from Port-au-Prince to the border with the Dominican Republic, according to the NHC advisory.

Already, three people have died in Haiti, including two killed in a landslide in the capital Port-au-Prince and another struck by a falling tree in Marigot, officials said.

A fourth person was killed in the Dominican Republic, where another remains missing.

Jamaica’s Meteorological Service principal director Evan Thompson told The Gleaner that residents should brace for a “double effect” as the hurricane’s eye passes over the island, with the strongest winds hitting from opposite directions on either side of the centre.

The forecast marks a significant shift from earlier in the week, when landfall was considered only a “slim chance”.

Authorities have readied more than 650 emergency shelters across Jamaica and said airports will close once a hurricane warning is declared. Prime Minister Andrew Holness warned the public to treat the approaching storm as a serious threat. “Take all measures to protect yourself,” he said.

The storm has already wrought havoc in the Dominican Republic, where nearly 200 homes have been damaged and more than half a million people left without water.

In the Los Rios neighbourhood of the capital, Santo Domingo, families were forced to flee rising floodwaters on Thursday evening after surrounding streams burst their banks, according to the Listin Diario daily newspaper.

More than two dozen Dominican communities remain cut off by floodwaters, prompting mandatory evacuations and nationwide school closures.

The situation is particularly dire for thousands displaced by gang violence in Port-au-Prince, now living in makeshift shelters with scant protection.

“I’m dealing with two storms: the gangs and the weather,” Nephtali Johnson Pierre told The Associated Press news agency.

Tropical Storm Melissa has been pushing through the central Caribbean, with forecasters warning it could soon strengthen and brush past Jamaica as a powerful hurricane while unleashing potentially “catastrophic” flash flooding and landslides in southern Haiti.

The slow-moving and erratic storm was centred on Friday about 150 miles (245km) southeast of Kingston, Jamaica, and about 270 miles (430km) southwest of Port-au-Prince, Haiti.

It had maximum sustained winds of 45mph (75km/h) and was moving north at 3mph (6km/h), according to the United States National Hurricane Center in Miami.

It was expected to drop copious rain on Jamaica and the southern regions of Haiti and the Dominican Republic through the weekend as it strengthens into a major hurricane by the end of the weekend, possibly reaching Category 4 status by Tuesday.

Forecasters said Jamaica’s eastern region could see up to 14 inches (36cm) of rain that could lead to flooding and landslides because of the ground already being saturated due to recent heavy rains unrelated to the storm.

Melissa was blamed for downing a large tree that killed an elderly man in the coastal town of Marigot in southern Haiti, while five other people were injured in flooding in the central Artibonite area, according to the Civil Protection Agency.

The United Nations announced on Thursday that it was preparing more than 100 emergency shelters in Haiti’s southern region. Haiti has been devastated by past storms, given widespread erosion and limited preparation due to gang violence, poverty and weak governance.

The storm also knocked out dozens of water supply systems in the Dominican Republic, affecting more than half a million customers. It also downed trees and traffic lights and unleashed several small landslides.

All public schools across the Dominican Republic would close on Friday, while government offices in 12 provinces under alert would do the same, officials said.

In Jamaica, Matthew Samuda, the minister of economic growth and job creation, said the situation was “serious” and warned people not to be fooled by the storm’s current pace and strength. “Be very attentive, because it can change in a moment’s notice,” he said.

Melissa is the 13th named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season, and the first named storm to form in the Caribbean this year.

The US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration had predicted an above-normal season – runs from June 1 to November 30 – with 13 to 18 named storms.

People in Jamaica are bracing for the impact of Hurricane Melissa, which is forecast to unleash destructive winds and bring catastrophic flooding to the Caribbean nation in the coming hours. Melissa was upgraded to a category five hurricane - the maximum strength - early on Monday, the US-based National Hurricane Center (NHC) said. The authorities fear that Melissa, which has already been blamed for the deaths of four people on the island of Hispaniola, could become the strongest hurricane ever to hit Jamaica.

REUTERS/Gilbert Bellamy Big waves were already breaking on the coast of Jamaica on Saturday, a storm surge is expected later on Monday and into Tuesday

The Jamaican government has ordered evacuations for parts of the capital, Kingston, and the entire island has been classed as ""threatened"". An update from the NHC at 12:00GMT said that Melissa was about 135 miles (220km) southwest of Kingston, Jamaica.

It has maximum sustained wind speeds of 160mph (260km/h) and could strengthen further in the next 12 to 24 hours, forecasters warned. If it continues on the forecasted track, its core is expected ""to move near or over Jamaica tonight and Tuesday, across south-eastern Cuba Tuesday night, and across the south-eastern Bahamas on Wednesday"". The storm is particularly slow moving, which makes it very dangerous in terms of expected rainfall amounts. According to the NHC, 40 inches of rain (100cm) are possible in parts of Jamaica over the next four days.

Forecasters warn that destructive winds and life-threatening storm surges are expected to hit Jamaica overnight or early on Tuesday. Jamaica's Prime Minister Andrew Holness has ordered the immediate evacuation of several vulnerable communities across the island. Officials also urged residents in low-lying and flood-prone areas to seek shelter in safer areas. Jamaica's Minister of Local Government, Desmond McKenzie, told local media that all of the island's 881 shelters were open.

Local media identified the victim as a 79-year-old man who had been swept away by floodwaters in the capital, Santo Domingo.

"Hurricane Melissa threatens to bring catastrophic flooding, landslides to Jamaica, Haiti, Cuba",,https://www.cbsnews.com,"Kingston, Jamaica — Hurricane Melissa intensified to Category 5 early Monday as it neared Jamaica, threatening to bring catastrophic flooding, landslides and widespread damage to homes and infrastructure. The storm is forecast to dump up to 30 inches of rain on Jamaica, along with life-threatening storm surge along its southern coast.

Melissa is expected to make landfall on the island Monday night and Tuesday and cross southeastern Cuba and the Bahamas through Wednesday.

Monday morning, the hurricane had maximum sustained winds of 160 mph and was inching west at a slow pace, just 3 mph, the center said.

Category 5 is the highest on the Saffir-Simpson scale, for storms with sustained winds of at least 157 mph — catastrophic strength capable of destroying many of the homes in its path. Melissa is the strongest hurricane in recent history to directly hit the small Caribbean nation.

""Destructive winds and storm surge and catastrophic flooding will worsen on Jamaica through the day and into tonight,"" CBS News meteorologist Nikki Nolan stressed.

In addition to the impact on Jamaica, western Haiti could get 16 inches of rain, bringing the threat of catastrophic flash flooding and landslides there too, the hurricane center warned.

The slow-moving storm has already killed at least three people in Haiti and a fourth in the Dominican Republic, where another person remains missing, according to authorities.

""I want to urge Jamaicans to take this seriously,"" said Desmond McKenzie, deputy chairman of Jamaica's Disaster Risk Management Council. ""Do not gamble with Melissa. It's not a safe bet.""

In addition to the rainfall, Melissa is likely to cause a life-threatening storm surge on Jamaica's southern coast, peaking as much as 13 feet above ground level, near and to the east of where the center of Melissa makes landfall, forecasters said.

The hurricane was expected to make another landfall later Tuesday in eastern Cuba. A hurricane warning was in effect for Granma, Santiago de Cuba, Guantánamo and Holguin provinces, while a tropical storm warning was in effect for Las Tunas. Up to 20 inches of rain were forecast for parts of Cuba, along with a significant storm surge along the coast.

Melissa could be the strongest hurricane Jamaica has experienced in decades, said Evan Thompson, principal director at Jamaica's meteorological service. He warned that cleanup and damage assessment would be severely delayed because of anticipated landslides, flooding and blocked roads.

""Don't make foolish decisions,"" warned Daryl Vaz, Jamaica's transport minister. ""We are in a very, very serious time over the next few days.""

The storm already has dropped heavy rain in the Dominican Republic, where schools and government offices were ordered to remain closed on Monday in four of nine provinces still under red alert. The Dominican Republic shares the island of Hispaniola with Haiti.

Melissa damaged more than 750 homes across The Dominican Republic , displacing more than 3,760 people. Floodwaters also have cut access to at least 48 communities, officials said.

In Haiti, the storm destroyed crops in three regions, including 37 acres of maize at a time when at least 5.7 million people, more than half the country's population, is experiencing crisis levels of hunger, with 1.9 million of those facing emergency levels of hunger.

""Flooding is obstructing access to farmland and markets, jeopardizing harvests and the winter agricultural season,"" the U.N.'s Food and Agriculture Organization said.

As of 8 a.m. ET, Melissa was packing winds of 160 mph. Hurricanes reach Category 5 — the top of the categories chart — when their winds hit 157 mph.

Hurricane Melissa, the 13th named storm of the Atlantic season, isn't expected to have major impacts on the mainland United States, but could turn out to be the strongest Atlantic system this season.

Melissa's forecast and path

As of 8 a.m. ET Monday, Melissa's center was about 135 miles south-southwest of Kingston, Jamaica, and about 320 miles south-southwest of Guantanamo, Cuba, the hurricane center said. Maximum sustained winds had strengthened to 160 mph,

with hurricane-force winds extending some 30 miles from the storm's center and tropical storm-force winds extending 195 miles. It was crawling west at 3 mph.

""Some additional strengthening is forecast today, with fluctuations in intensity likely before Melissa makes landfall on Jamaica early Tuesday. Melissa is expected to reach Jamaica and southeastern Cuba as a powerful major hurricane and will still be at hurricane strength when it moves across the southeastern Bahamas.""

When Melissa makes landfall, peak storm surge accompanied by destructive waves could reach 9 to 13 feet above ground level in Jamaica and 6 to 9 feet in Cuba, according to the NHC.

Melissa could be the most powerful hurricane ever to hit Jamaica, CBS News Philadelphia meteorologist Andrew Kozak said Saturday.

""The island's terrain makes it even worse,"" Kozak said. ""Jamaica's mountains force the air to rise, and that creates more rain.""

The strongest hurricane to pound Jamaica was Gilbert in 1988, Kozak said. It killed 45 people and caused more than $700 million in damage.

Will Hurricane Melissa impact South Florida? See its projected path.,,https://www.cbsnews.com,"Hurricane Melissa has formed in the Caribbean, making it the 13th named storm in the Atlantic this year, the Miami-based National Hurricane Center said. Monday morning, it became a powerful Category 5 hurricane.

The NEXT Weather team at CBS Miami said no direct impacts are expected to South Florida at this time, but indirect impacts such as rip currents and hazardous sea conditions will be possible mid-to-late next week. The team will continue to monitor and provide regular updates throughout the week. As of now, the storm is not projected to hit any parts of the mainland U.S.

The forecast models are still diverging and have not consolidated yet. Hence, there is low confidence in the forecast track, and the NEXT Weather Team is seeing more of a circle instead of a forecast ""cone"" for now.

Melissa first formed as a tropical storm on Tuesday and rapidly intensified into a Category 4 hurricane on Sunday morning.

Where is Melissa?

As of 7 a.m. Monday, Melissa's core was about 130 miles south-southwest of Kingston, Jamaica, and about 315 miles south-southwest of Guantanamo, Cuba, the NHC said.

Maximum sustained winds were 160 mph, with hurricane-force winds extending outward up to 30 miles from the hurricane's eye and tropical storm-force winds extending some 205 miles from the storm's center. It was moving west at just 3 mph.

Watches and warnings

Jamaica is under a hurricane warning as Melissa strengthens and approaches the island. The NHC projects that the storm will make landfall in Kingston on early Tuesday morning as a Category 5 hurricane, and then in eastern Cuba later Tuesday or early Wednesday.

Cuba's government has also issued a hurricane warning for the Cuban provinces of Granma, Santiago de Cuba, Guantanamo and Holguin.

Southwestern Haiti is under both a hurricane watch and a tropical storm warning, with heavy rain and dangerous flooding expected. A tropical storm warning has also been issued for the Cuban province of Las Tunas.

What are the impacts?

Tropical storm conditions from Melissa are likely occurring in Jamaica, with hurricane conditions expected to begin by Monday.

Tropical storm conditions are expected to begin in Eastern Cuba by Tuesday afternoon, with Hurricane conditions expected to begin in the hurricane warning area by Tuesday evening.

Tropical storm conditions are ongoing in the warning area in Haiti. The potential for hurricane conditions in the watch area in Haiti has diminished for today, but there is still a possibility of hurricane conditions occurring there on Tuesday.

Melissa is expected to bring rainfall of 15 to 30 inches to portions of Jamaica and additional rainfall of 8 to 16 inches for southern Hispaniola through Wednesday, with local storm total maxima of 40 inches possible. Catastrophic flash flooding and numerous landslides are likely.

For eastern Cuba, storm total rainfall of 10 to 15 inches, with local amounts to 20 inches, is expected by Monday into Wednesday, resulting in life-threatening flash flooding and numerous landslides.

Over the Southeast Bahamas, total rainfall of 4 to 8 inches is expected Tuesday into Wednesday, resulting in areas of flash flooding.

Life-threatening storm surge is likely along the south coast of Jamaica late Monday through Tuesday morning. Peak storm surge heights could reach 9 to 13 feet above ground level, near and to the east of where the center of Melissa makes landfall. Large and destructive waves will accompany this storm surge.

There is a potential for significant storm surge along the southeast coast of Cuba late Tuesday or Wednesday. Peak storm surge heights could reach 6 to 9 feet above normal tide levels, near and to the east of where the center of Melissa makes landfall. Large and destructive waves will accompany this storm surge.

Swells generated by Melissa are expected to affect portions of Hispaniola, Jamaica, eastern Cuba, and the Cayman Islands during the next several days, and in the Bahamas and Bermuda later this week.

These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.

By early next week, the storm will be near or over Eastern Cuba and the Bahamas.

Global Empowerment Mission prepares emergency supplies for countries impacted by Hurricane Melissa,,https://www.cbsnews.com,"As countries in the Caribbean are going to face the brunt of Hurricane Melissa, South Florida organizations are doing what they can to help.

In Doral, the Global Empowerment Mission (GEM) is currently preparing to ship hundreds of boxes to those in need.

Responding to natural disasters is GEM's specialty, and the nonprofit already has at least 2,000 boxes with food, water and toiletries packed and ready to go. But, staff members tell CBS News Miami that they're going to stock about 3,000 more.

Inside the boxes are items like soup, oats, snacks, water and canned protein — totalling about 10,000 calories of food — as well as toothbrushes, socks, toothpaste and soap. The boxes even include small makeup kits for women.

GEM staff members told CBS News Miami that they want to send over items that can make those impacted feel a sense of normalcy during a disaster.

""The big thing for them is they want to feel like themselves, right? And when you're out of place from not being in your home, it's a totally different world for you after the shell shock of disaster,"" said Billy Richardson, GEM's director of U.S. warehouseing.

"Hurricane Melissa bringing rough currents and waves to Fort Lauderdale Beach, Ocean Rescue officials warn",,https://www.cbsnews.com,"As Hurricane Melissa grows in the Caribbean, the Category 4 storm can be felt just as much in South Florida.

Throughout the weekend, the hurricane has brought rough surf conditions, causing water rescue officials to urge swimmers to stay out of the water.

Manuel Dominguez wanted to take a quick dip to cool off from his morning run. But it was rough.

""It's one wave after the other and because of the wind plus the waves, it's just banging and banging and banging,"" Dominguez said.

And within minutes of going in, here comes a lifeguard to check on him.

""She told me not to go very far — just stay up close to the shore,"" Dominguez said.

Fort Lauderdale Ocean Rescue said the conditions aren't safe for most swimmers this weekend, attributing the rough current to Melissa, which is ripping through the Caribbean.

""Being here so close to the Caribbean water, especially with warm water, we're definitely seeing some effect from it,"" said Fort Lauderdale Ocean Rescue Lt. David Ochoa.

So they're urging everyone to stay out of the water this weekend, or they could get taken further out by the current.

""You get pulled off to shore in one of the rip currents, and we effect a water rescue and take it from there,"" Ochoa said. ""They are life-threatening, with the more onshore winds, you get the stronger they get for consecutive days.""

If you are ever unsure about whether it's safe or not to go in the ocean, just head to your nearest lifeguard tower and look at the flags. On Sunday, there was a red flag -- that means there high hazard, and it's highly recommended that you don't go in the water.

Ulyana Gural and her family are visiting from Chicago. They didn't need to see a red flag to decide that today is not a swimming day.

""Today and yesterday, it looks really dangerous, so we're not risking it,"" Gural said.

"Massachusetts woman worries for family in Jamaica as Hurricane Melissa could bring mud slides, flooding",,https://www.cbsnews.com,"A woman in Massachusetts is worried for her family in Jamaica as Hurricane Melissa could bring catastrophic flooding to the island.

Hurricane Melissa is currently a Category 4 hurricane, but could strengthen to a Category 5 before it hits Jamaica and Haiti in the coming days. The storm could bring up to 30 inches of rain to the island and cause damage to infrastructure.

""I am really concerned about mud slides,"" Framingham resident and real-estate agent JoAnn Frye said.

Frye owns an Airbnb in Ocho Rios, Jamaica, at Pyramid Point. She said that she has already lost power to her outdoor video cameras and that her home manager moved everything inside in anticipation of the storm.

""I'm very nervous. I've been watching this WhatsApp group because that's how we communicate in the community,"" Frye said.

Residents in Jamaica prepare for Hurricane Melissa

Jamaica's Prime Minister, Andrew Holness, urged residents to take the storm very seriously.

""We've been prepared for a couple of days now. We have gas generators. We have extra water in the rooms, and then we have some larger tanks of water prepared for that, just in case power goes out. We have some solar lights,"" said Frye's cousin, Mark Walker, who lives on the island.

He plans on hunkering down with his family for the next few days.

""It's one of those scenarios where it's not just us, it's everyone else, but we have a pretty good group of neighbors and friends that are close by, kind of looking out for each other,"" Walker said.

Joanne says she's glad she's not there, but is praying for her people in Jamaica.

""I'm still scared for the people I know and love there. I'm scared for the community,"" Frye said.

She said that she plans to fly down once the storm passes to check on her loved ones and her home.
